## Description
Capstoned aims to address a critical issue faced by students - the lack of an efficient system for managing their Final Year Projects (FYPs). To alleviate this problem, we propose the development of an innovative FYP Management System. This comprehensive solution will connect students, supervisors, co-supervisors, and industry mentors, fostering seamless collaboration and information exchange.

## 🛠 My Contributions

### 1. User Research & Journey Mapping
- Conducted 20+ interviews with students, supervisors, co-supervisors, and industry mentors to uncover pain points in proposal submission, feedback loops, and scheduling.  
- Mapped and optimized user journeys from idea conception through supervisor review to final delivery, defining intuitive, role-based dashboard wireframes.

### 2. UX/UI Strategy & Prototyping
- Led low- and high-fidelity prototyping in Figma, iterating on stakeholder feedback to ensure ease of use and clear workflow visibility.  
- Defined the component library and style guide in React + Tailwind to guarantee consistency across all stakeholder interfaces.

### 3. AI-Powered “Uniqueness Detector”
- Designed and implemented the real-time duplication-flagging pipeline using TensorFlow and NLP techniques (semantic similarity, tokenization).  
- Integrated the detector into the proposal submission flow to catch overlapping ideas immediately.

### 4. Backend Architecture & REST APIs
- Architected and built Node.js/Express services for user authentication, data integration, and AI orchestration.  
- Wrote comprehensive unit and integration tests to validate all endpoints and data schemas.

### 5. Real-Time Communication & Notifications
- Developed WebSocket channels (Socket.io) for live chat, status updates, and calendar events.  
- Built and wired up front-end components to ensure low-latency, reliable messaging across all dashboards.

### 6. Quality Assurance & Security
- Participated in Agile ceremonies (daily stand-ups, sprint retrospectives) to drive continuous improvement.  
- Conducted peer code reviews, automated security scans, and white-hat penetration tests to harden authentication flows and API endpoints.

### 7. Pilot Impact
- Achieved a 45% reduction in feedback cycle time (from 72 hr to 40 hr) through faster APIs and real-time alerts.  
- Eliminated scheduling conflicts during the pilot with integrated notifications and calendar sync.  
- Contributed to a 92% overall satisfaction score in post-pilot SUS surveys, reflecting system reliability and UX quality.
